                    These Terms and your use of Spectrum's Service are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which Spectrum operates, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that jurisdiction for any legal proceedings arising from or relating to these Terms or the Service.

                    If you have a dispute with Spectrum, we encourage you to contact us first to attempt to resolve the matter informally. Before initiating any legal proceedings, you agree to attempt to resolve disputes through good faith negotiation.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    If informal resolution is unsuccessful, either party may pursue formal legal action. By agreeing to these Terms, you consent to resolve disputes through binding arbitration rather than court proceedings, except where prohibited by law.
